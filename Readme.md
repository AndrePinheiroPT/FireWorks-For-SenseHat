# Firework Module

Welcome to my work, In this work I built a python module
to use in your raspberry and SenseHat!

## Hardware

For you use this module you need:
- Raspberry Pi
- SenseHat

If you no have a Raspberry pi or SenseHat, you can use a SenseHat
emulator for exemple: The trinket

[Trinket](https://trinket.io/sense-hat)

## How to use?

1. Download the FireWorkModule.py
2. Add the module in your program
3. Run :)

## Command

```python
import FireWorkModule

FireWorkModule.fire()
# params:
# - color;
# - position;
# - velocity;
# - background;
# - height;
```
